### Why Simblog

After searching a lot, I found no good `hosted`, `free`, `markdown-based` blogging platform. [Ghost](https://ghost.org) is the closest to programmer friendly blogging platform but the hosted solution is [too expensive](https://ghost.org/pricing/) for an enthusiast blogger.
Medium is also a good contender but there is not good code snippet support, creating gist for everything is very frustrating at times.
I found that setting up Jekyll on Github pages is the closest to the solution I was trying to find. The only problem is the overhead of setting it up is too much. Also, changing theme is a massive project in itself sometimes.

So, `Simblog` aims to make this process as easy as possible. Its not only code but also a tutorial on how you can blog as easy as possible, using the tools you love.
